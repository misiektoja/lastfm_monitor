<a id="installation"></a>
## Installation

<a id="install-from-pypi"></a>
### Install from PyPI

```sh
pip install lastfm_monitor
```

<a id="manual-installation"></a>
### Manual Installation

Download the *[lastfm_monitor.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misiektoja/lastfm_monitor/refs/heads/main/lastfm_monitor.py)* file to the desired location.

Install dependencies via pip:

```sh
pip install pylast requests python-dateutil spotipy python-dotenv
```

Alternatively, from the downloaded *[requirements.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misiektoja/lastfm_monitor/refs/heads/main/requirements.txt)*:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<a id="quick-start"></a>
## Quick Start

- Grab your [Last.fm API Key and Shared Secret](#lastfm-api-key-and-shared-secret) and track the `lastfm_username` music activities:


```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -u "your_lastfm_api_key" -w "your_lastfm_api_secret"
```

Or if you installed [manually](#manual-installation):

```sh
python3 lastfm_monitor.py <lastfm_username> -u "your_lastfm_api_key" -w "your_lastfm_api_secret"
```

To get the list of all supported command-line arguments / flags:

```sh
lastfm_monitor --help
```

<a id="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

<a id="configuration-file"></a>
### Configuration File

Most settings can be configured via command-line arguments.

If you want to have it stored persistently, generate a default config template and save it to a file named `lastfm_monitor.conf`:

```sh
lastfm_monitor --generate-config > lastfm_monitor.conf

```

Edit the `lastfm_monitor.conf` file and change any desired configuration options (detailed comments are provided for each).

<a id="lastfm-api-key-and-shared-secret"></a>
### Last.fm API Key and Shared Secret

Create your Last.fm `API key` and `Shared secret` at: [https://www.last.fm/api/account/create](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)

Or get your existing credentials from: [https://www.last.fm/api/accounts](https://www.last.fm/api/accounts)

Provide the `LASTFM_API_KEY` and `LASTFM_API_SECRET` secrets using one of the following methods:
 - Pass it at runtime with `-u` / `--lastfm-api-key` and `-w` / `--lastfm-secret`
 - Set it as an [environment variable](#storing-secrets) (e.g. `export LASTFM_API_KEY=...; export LASTFM_API_SECRET=...`)
 - Add it to [.env file](#storing-secrets) (`LASTFM_API_KEY=...` and `LASTFM_API_SECRET=...`) for persistent use

Fallback:
 - Hard-code it in the code or config file

If you store the `LASTFM_API_KEY` and `LASTFM_API_SECRET` in a dotenv file you can update their values and send a `SIGHUP` signal to the process to reload the file with the new secret values without restarting the tool. More info in [Storing Secrets](#storing-secrets) and [Signal Controls (macOS/Linux/Unix)](#signal-controls-macoslinuxunix).

<a id="user-privacy-settings"></a>
### User Privacy Settings

In order to monitor Last.fm user activity, proper privacy settings need to be enabled on the monitored user account.

The user should go to [Last.fm Privacy Settings](https://www.last.fm/settings/privacy).

The **Hide recent listening information** setting should be disabled. 

Otherwise you will get this error message returned by the `pyLast` library: *'Login: User required to be logged in'*.

<a id="spotify-client-id-and-secret-optional"></a>
### Spotify Client ID and Secret (optional)

If you want to obtain the [track duration from Spotify](#getting-track-duration-from-spotify) or use the [automatic playback functionality](#automatic-playback-of-listened-tracks-in-the-spotify-client), you need to get Spotify credentials to perform the Client Credentials OAuth flow.

- Log in to Spotify Developer dashboard: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
- Create a new app
- For **Redirect URL**, use: http://127.0.0.1:1234
- Select **Web API** as the intended API
- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

Provide the `SP_CLIENT_ID` and `SP_CLIENT_SECRET` secrets using one of the following methods:
 - Pass it at runtime with `-z` / `--spotify-creds` (use `SP_CLIENT_ID`:`SP_CLIENT_SECRET` format - note the colon separator)
 - Set it as an [environment variable](#storing-secrets) (e.g. `export SP_CLIENT_ID=...; export SP_CLIENT_SECRET=...`)
 - Add it to [.env file](#storing-secrets) (`SP_CLIENT_ID=...` and `SP_CLIENT_SECRET=...`) for persistent use

Fallback:
 - Hard-code it in the code or config file

Example:

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -z "your_spotify_app_client_id:your_spotify_app_client_secret"
```

The tool takes care of refreshing the access token so it should remain valid indefinitely.

If you store the `SP_CLIENT_ID` and `SP_CLIENT_SECRET` in a dotenv file you can update their values and send a `SIGHUP` signal to reload the file with the new secret values without restarting the tool. More info in [Storing Secrets](#storing-secrets) and [Signal Controls (macOS/Linux/Unix)](#signal-controls-macoslinuxunix).

<a id="smtp-settings"></a>
### SMTP Settings

If you want to use email notifications functionality, configure SMTP settings in the `lastfm_monitor.conf` file. 

Verify your SMTP settings by using `--send-test-email` flag (the tool will try to send a test email notification):

```sh
lastfm_monitor --send-test-email
```

<a id="storing-secrets"></a>
### Storing Secrets

It is recommended to store secrets like `LASTFM_API_KEY`, `LASTFM_API_SECRET`, `SP_CLIENT_ID`, `SP_CLIENT_SECRET` or `SMTP_PASSWORD` as either an environment variable or in a dotenv file.

Set environment variables using `export` on **Linux/Unix/macOS/WSL** systems:

```sh
export LASTFM_API_KEY="your_lastfm_api_key"
export LASTFM_API_SECRET="your_lastfm_api_secret"
export SP_CLIENT_ID="your_spotify_app_client_id"
export SP_CLIENT_SECRET="your_spotify_app_client_secret"
export SMTP_PASSWORD="your_smtp_password"
```

On **Windows Command Prompt** use `set` instead of `export` and on **Windows PowerShell** use `$env`.

Alternatively store them persistently in a dotenv file (recommended):

```ini
LASTFM_API_KEY="your_lastfm_api_key"
LASTFM_API_SECRET="your_lastfm_api_secret"
SP_CLIENT_ID="your_spotify_app_client_id"
SP_CLIENT_SECRET="your_spotify_app_client_secret"
SMTP_PASSWORD="your_smtp_password"
```

By default the tool will auto-search for dotenv file named `.env` in current directory and then upward from it. 

You can specify a custom file with `DOTENV_FILE` or `--env-file` flag:

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> --env-file /path/.env-lastfm_monitor
```

 You can also disable `.env` auto-search with `DOTENV_FILE = "none"` or `--env-file none`:

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> --env-file none
```

As a fallback, you can also store secrets in the configuration file or source code.

<a id="usage"></a>
## Usage

<a id="monitoring-mode"></a>
### Monitoring Mode

To monitor specific user activity, just type Last.fm username as a command-line argument (`lastfm_username` in the example below):

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username>
```

If you have not set `LASTFM_API_KEY` and `LASTFM_API_SECRET` secrets, you can use `-u` and `-w` flags:

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -u "your_lastfm_api_key" -w "your_lastfm_api_secret"
```

If you want to obtain the [track duration from Spotify](#getting-track-duration-from-spotify) or use the [automatic playback functionality](#automatic-playback-of-listened-tracks-in-the-spotify-client) and you have not set `SP_CLIENT_ID` and `SP_CLIENT_SECRET`, you can use `-z` flag:

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -z "your_spotify_app_client_id:your_spotify_app_client_secret"
```

By default, the tool looks for a configuration file named `lastfm_monitor.conf` in:
 - current directory 
 - home directory (`~`)
 - script directory 

 If you generated a configuration file as described in [Configuration](#configuration), but saved it under a different name or in a different directory, you can specify its location using the `--config-file` flag:


```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> --config-file /path/lastfm_monitor_new.conf
```

The tool runs until interrupted (`Ctrl+C`). Use `tmux` or `screen` for persistence.

You can monitor multiple Last.fm users by running multiple copies of the script.

The tool automatically saves its output to `lastfm_monitor_<username>.log` file. It can be changed in the settings via `LF_LOGFILE` configuration option or disabled completely via `DISABLE_LOGGING` / `-d` flag.

The tool also saves the last activity information (artist, track, timestamp) to `lastfm_<username>_last_activity.json file`, so it can be reused in case the tool needs to be restarted.

<a id="listing-mode"></a>
### Listing Mode

There is another mode of the tool that prints the recently listened tracks for the user (`-l` flag). 

You can also add the `-n` flag to specify how many tracks should be displayed, by default it shows the last 30 tracks:

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -l  -n 10
```

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misiektoja/lastfm_monitor/refs/heads/main/assets/lastfm_monitor_listing.png" alt="lastfm_monitor_listing" width="90%"/>
</p>

If you want to not only display, but also save the list of recently listened track to a CSV file, use the `-l` flag with `-b` indicating the CSV file. As before, you can add the `-n` flag to specify how many tracks should be displayed/saved:

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -l -n 10 -b lastfm_tracks_username.csv
```

<a id="email-notifications"></a>
### Email Notifications

To enable email notifications when a user becomes active:
- set `ACTIVE_NOTIFICATION` to `True`
- or use the `-a` flag

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -a
```

To be informed when a user gets inactive:
- set `INACTIVE_NOTIFICATION` to `True`
- or use the `-i` flag

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -i
```

To be notified when new entries appear when the user is offline:
- set `OFFLINE_ENTRIES_NOTIFICATION` to `True`
- or use the `-f` flag

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -f
```

To get email notifications when a monitored track or album plays:
- set `TRACK_NOTIFICATION` to `True`
- or use the `-t` flag

For that feature you also need to create a file with a list of songs you want to track (one track or album per line). Specify the file using the `MONITOR_LIST_FILE` or `-s` flag:

Example file `lastfm_tracks_username`:

```
we fell in love in october
Like a Stone
Half Believing
Something Changed
I Will Be There
```

You can comment out specific lines with # if needed.

Then run the tool with `-t` and `-s` flags:

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -t -s lastfm_tracks_username
```

To enable email notifications for every song listened by the user:
- set `SONG_NOTIFICATION` to `True`
- or use the `-j` flag

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -j
```

To be notified when a user listens to the same song on loop:
- set `SONG_ON_LOOP_NOTIFICATION` to `True`
- or use the `-x` flag

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -x
```

To disable sending an email on errors (enabled by default):
- set `ERROR_NOTIFICATION` to `False`
- or use the `-e` flag

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -e
```

Make sure you defined your SMTP settings earlier (see [SMTP settings](#smtp-settings)).

Example email:

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misiektoja/lastfm_monitor/refs/heads/main/assets/lastfm_monitor_email_notifications.png" alt="lastfm_monitor_email_notifications" width="90%"/>
</p>

<a id="csv-export"></a>
### CSV Export

If you want to save all listened songs to a CSV file, set `CSV_FILE` or use `-b` flag:

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -b lastfm_tracks_username.csv
```

The file will be automatically created if it does not exist.

<a id="automatic-playback-of-listened-tracks-in-the-spotify-client"></a>
### Automatic Playback of Listened Tracks in the Spotify Client

If you want the tool to automatically play the tracks listened to by the user in your local Spotify client:
- set `TRACK_SONGS` to `True`
- or use the `-g` flag

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -g
```

Your Spotify client needs to be installed and running for this feature to work.

In order to use this functionality you need to have Spotipy installed as described [here](#installation) and properly defined Spotify client ID and secret values as described [here](#spotify-client-id-and-secret-optional).

The tool fully supports automatic playback on **Linux** and **macOS**. This means it will automatically play the changed track. It will also automatically pause and resume playback following the tracked user's actions. Additionally, it can pause or play an indicated track once the user becomes inactive (see the `SP_USER_GOT_OFFLINE_TRACK_ID` configuration option).

For **Windows**, it works in a semi-automatic way: if you have the Spotify client running and you are not listening to any song, then the first track will play automatically. However, subsequent tracks will be located in the client, but you will need to press the play button manually. 

You can change the playback method per platform using the corresponding configuration option.

For **macOS** set `SPOTIFY_MACOS_PLAYING_METHOD` to one of the following values:
-  "**apple-script**" (recommended, **default**)
-  "trigger-url"

For **Linux** set `SPOTIFY_LINUX_PLAYING_METHOD` to one of the following values:
- "**dbus-send**" (most common one, **default**)
- "qdbus" (try if dbus-send does not work)
- "trigger-url"

For **Windows** set `SPOTIFY_WINDOWS_PLAYING_METHOD` to one of the following values:
- "**start-uri**" (recommended, **default**)
- "spotify-cmd"
- "trigger-url"

The recommended defaults should work for most people.

<a id="progress-indicator"></a>
### Progress Indicator

If you want to see a real-time progress indicator showing the exact minute and second of the track the user is currently listening to:
- set `PROGRESS_INDICATOR` to `True`
- or use the `-p` flag

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -p
```

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misiektoja/lastfm_monitor/refs/heads/main/assets/lastfm_monitor_progress_indicator.png" alt="lastfm_monitor_progress_indicator" width="90%"/>
</p>

For this functionality to work correctly, it is suggested to set the active check interval (`LASTFM_ACTIVE_CHECK_INTERVAL` / `-k` flag) to a low value (such as 2-5 seconds).

<a id="getting-track-duration-from-spotify"></a>
### Getting Track Duration from Spotify

If you want the tool to fetch the track duration from Spotify instead of Last.fm, which very often reports the wrong duration (or none at all):
- set `USE_TRACK_DURATION_FROM_SPOTIFY` to `True`
- or use the `-r` flag

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -r
```

In order to use this functionality you need to have Spotipy installed as described [here](#installation) and properly defined Spotify client ID and secret values as described [here](#spotify-client-id-and-secret-optional).

You will be able to tell if the track duration comes from Spotify as it has an S* suffix at the end (e.g. **3 minutes 42 seconds S\***), while those coming from Last.fm have an L* (e.g. **2 minutes 13 seconds L\***).

You can disable showing the track duration marks (L* S*) via the `-q` flag.

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -r -q
```

Duration marks are not displayed if the functionality to retrieve track duration from Spotify is disabled.

<a id="private-mode-detection-in-spotify"></a>
### Private Mode Detection in Spotify

The tool includes functionality to detect when private mode is potentially used in Spotify and even estimates the duration of its usage. It is enabled by default and is not configurable.

It is not 100% accurate. I have observed that when private mode is used, especially for extended periods, it often results in many duplicate entries being created in a Last.fm account after private mode is disabled. This leads to different tracks having the same start timestamp.

I suspect this is related to a bug in Spotify and mainly occurs when the user has Spotify on multiple devices.

However, keep in mind that this is not 100% accurate. I have observed duplicate entries even without private mode, but in such cases, the number of duplicate entries is limited. Therefore, do not treat it as something completely certain, but it is a pretty good indicator that private mode was used.

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misiektoja/lastfm_monitor/refs/heads/main/assets/lastfm_monitor_private_mode.png" alt="lastfm_monitor_private_mode" width="90%"/>
</p>

<a id="check-intervals"></a>
### Check Intervals

If you want to customize polling intervals, use `-k` and `-c` flags (or corresponding configuration options):

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -k 2 -c 10 
```

* `LASTFM_ACTIVE_CHECK_INTERVAL`, `-k`: check interval when the user is online, i.e. currently playing (seconds)
* `LASTFM_CHECK_INTERVAL`, `-c`: check interval when the user is considered offline, i.e. not playing music (seconds)

If you want to change the time required to mark the user as inactive (the timer starts once the user stops playing the music), use `-o` flag (or `LASTFM_INACTIVITY_CHECK` configuration option):

```sh
lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username> -o 120
```

<a id="signal-controls-macoslinuxunix"></a>
### Signal Controls (macOS/Linux/Unix)

The tool has several signal handlers implemented which allow to change behavior of the tool without a need to restart it with new configuration options / flags.

List of supported signals:

| Signal | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| USR1 | Toggle email notifications when user gets active/inactive or new offline entries show up (-a, -i, -f) |
| USR2 | Toggle email notifications for every song (-j) |
| URG  | Toggle showing of progress indicator (-p) |
| CONT | Toggle email notifications for tracked songs (-t) |
| PIPE | Toggle email notifications when user plays song on loop (-x) |
| TRAP | Increase the inactivity check timer (by 30 seconds) (-o) |
| ABRT | Decrease the inactivity check timer (by 30 seconds) (-o) |
| HUP | Reload secrets from .env file |

Send signals with `kill` or `pkill`, e.g.:

```sh
pkill -USR1 -f "lastfm_monitor <lastfm_username>"
```

As Windows supports limited number of signals, this functionality is available only on Linux/Unix/macOS.

<a id="coloring-log-output-with-grc"></a>
### Coloring Log Output with GRC

You can use [GRC](https://github.com/garabik/grc) to color logs.

Add to your GRC config (`~/.grc/grc.conf`):

```
# monitoring log file
.*_monitor_.*\.log
conf.monitor_logs
```

Now copy the [conf.monitor_logs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misiektoja/lastfm_monitor/refs/heads/main/grc/conf.monitor_logs) to your `~/.grc/` and log files should be nicely colored when using `grc` tool.

Example:

```sh
grc tail -F -n 100 lastfm_monitor_<username>.log
```
